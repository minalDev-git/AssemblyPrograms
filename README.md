# Assembly Programs

This repository contains a diverse collection of x86 Assembly Language programs, developed as part of academic learning and exploration of low-level programming. These programs demonstrate fundamental operations, control flow, stack manipulation, string handling, and usage of graphics — all written in MASM/TASM syntax for 16-bit DOS environments.


## 📚 Contents
### 🧾 Basic Programs

- Print a single character on screen
- Print your name character by character
- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers
- Input two numbers and add them
- Declare variables of different types (DB, DW, etc.) and print them on separate lines
- Print two different strings on different lines
- Print alphabets from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa
- Take user input and compare it with a predefined value
- Print an array using a loop
- Input a string and print it
- Multiply two numbers and display the product
- Divide two numbers and display quotient and remainder

### 🌀 Stack & String Operations
- Swap two numbers using stack
- Reverse a string using stack

### 🔁 Pattern & Loop Demonstrations
- Display * patterns using nested loops
- Usage of procedures and macros for modular programming

## 🎨 Advanced Programs with Graphics
### 1. 🆘 Morse Code Converter (Graphics + File I/O)
- Accepts user input (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) and converts it to Morse code.
- Rejects invalid characters and prompts for re-entry.
- Supports up to 100 characters in a string.
- Outputs Morse code to a text file.
- Displays a main screen with project title, loading bar, and percentage.
- Allows restarting the converter.

### 2. 🕹️ Pong Game (Interactive Game)
- Main Menu with 3 options:
    - Singleplayer (2 users)
    - Multiplayer (1 user vs Computer)
    - Exit Game
- First player to reach 5 points wins.
- Option to restart the game.




## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Assembler: MASM
- Platform: DOSBox (16-bit Real Mode)
- Language: x86 Assembly (Intel Syntax)
- IDE Notepad++

## 🎯 Purpose
#### This repository was created to:
- Strengthen understanding of Assembly language fundamentals
- Practice low-level memory and stack manipulation
- Build interactive and graphical applications in Assembly
- Serve as a resource for students and hobbyists learning x86 Assembly

## 📁 Getting Started
- #### 1. Clone the repository 
- #### 2. Run programs using DOSBox
- #### 3. Assemble with MASM
```bash
    masm program.asm
    link program.obj
    program.exe
```
